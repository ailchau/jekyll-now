title: Project 1: MTA Subway Data
---

This week I finished my first project at Metis. Our goal was to help WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY), a fictitious organization, devise a strategy to build public awareness about their organization and mission. Over the 4 days, my partner and I explored the New York MTA subway data to make our recommendations of locations to place street teams at entrances to subway stations.

Keeping in mind that WTWY had limited resources, we approached this problem by targeting women and individuals involved in the tech industry because they would identify most with WTWY's mission. In the end, we recommended high traffic subway stations located in tech hubs, areas with a high number of tech companies, start ups, and bootcamps. We also recommended subway stations in residential areas with higher numbers of women and tech employees (based on census data).

Here are a couple of fun things we found while exploring the data:

Between 8 am to 10 pm, the Grand Central - 42nd St Station was by far the busiest subway station.

Half of all the subway stations have over 587 people entering the station per hour. The black line indicates the median.

As we would expect, stations are the busiest during the week compared to the weekend.


#### Reflections

This project was a great exercise to familiarize myself with numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. Although the MTA subway data was publicly available online, there were many inconsistencies in how the data was collected and recorded. I was able to appreciate how data scientists spend a majority of their data work flow cleaning and organizing data. At times, I found cleaning the data to be a bit challenging, but I was pleased when I was able to find a solution.

Although I have used R and ggplot2 before, I had less experience with analyzing data in python.
I have more confidence in my ability to use python.

> As we mentioned, we are interested in harnessing the power of data and analytics to optimize the effectiveness of our street team work, which is a significant portion of our fundraising efforts.
>
> WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As we are new and inclusive organization, we try to do double duty with the gala both to fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.
>
> To this end we place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to our gala.
>
> Where we’d like to solicit your engagement is to use MTA subway data, which as I’m sure you know is available freely from the city, to help us optimize the placement of our street teams, such that we can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and contribute to our cause.
